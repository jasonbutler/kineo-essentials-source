adapt-contrib-spoor
===================

##Usage instructions
In order to get this to work in adapt_framework, your course will need tracking IDs, the insertion/removal of these can be automated using the <a href="https://github.com/kevadsett/adapt-grunt-trackingIds" target="_blank">adapt-grunt-trackingIds</a> grunt task suite.

Then, after grunt dev or grunt build has been run, copy all files from adapt-contrib-spoor/required into the root of the build folder.
